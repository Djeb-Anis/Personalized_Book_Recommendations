**Personalized Book Recommendation App** This application can help users discover new books based on their reading preferences, past reads, and mood. Here’s a breakdown of the features.

### Features

1. **User Profiles**: Allow users to create profiles where they can log their favorite genres, authors, and books they’ve read.

2. **Book Database**: Use an SQL database to store book information, including:
   - Title
   - Author
   - Genre
   - Summary
   - User ratings
   - Mood tags (e.g., uplifting, thought-provoking, etc.)

3. **Recommendation Engine**: Implement a simple algorithm that suggests books based on user preferences and past ratings. For example, if a user rates a mystery novel highly, recommend similar books.

4. **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for books by title, author, or genre.

5. **Reading List**: Users can create a reading list to keep track of books they want to read in the future.

6. **User Ratings and Reviews**: Users can rate books and leave reviews, which can help improve recommendations for others.

7. **Mood-Based Recommendations**: Allow users to select their current mood and receive book suggestions that match that mood.

### Database Schema

- **Users**: `user_id`, `username`, `password_hash`, `email`
- **Books**: `book_id`, `title`, `author`, `genre`, `summary`, `mood_tags`
- **Ratings**: `rating_id`, `user_id`, `book_id`, `rating`, `review`
- **Reading_List**: `list_id`, `user_id`, `book_id`

### PyQt6 Interface

1. **Main Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface where users can see their reading list, recent recommendations, and a search bar.

2. **Book Entry Form**: A form for users to add books to their reading list or rate and review books.

3. **Recommendation Section**: A dedicated area that displays personalized book recommendations based on user preferences.

4. **Search Results**: A view that shows search results with options to view book details, rate, or add to the reading list.

5. **User Profile**: A section where users can manage their preferences and view their reading history.

### Getting Started

1. **Set Up the Database**: Use SQLite to create the necessary tables for users, books, ratings, and reading lists.

2. **Create the PyQt6 GUI**: Start with the main dashboard and gradually add forms for book entry, search, and recommendations.

3. **Implement Functionality**: Connect the GUI to the database using SQL queries to handle CRUD operations and implement the recommendation logic.

4. **Implement Functionality**: Use an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate concerns and make your code more maintainable.

5. **Test and Iterate**: Test the application for bugs and usability issues, and gather feedback to improve the user experience.

### MVC (Model-View-Controller)

MVC, or Model-View-Controller, is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. It separates an application into three interconnected components, which helps organize code, improve maintainability, and facilitate collaboration among developers. Here’s a breakdown of each component:

### Components of MVC

1. **Model**:
   - The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, including retrieving, storing, and processing it.
   - In your book recommendation app, the Model would include classes or functions that handle database interactions, such as fetching book data, user profiles, ratings, etc.

2. **View**:
   - The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It presents the user interface and handles the layout and design.
   - In your app, the View would be the PyQt6 GUI components, such as windows, buttons, forms, and any other visual elements that users interact with.

3. **Controller**:
   - The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and then updates the View accordingly.
   - In your app, the Controller would handle events like button clicks, form submissions, and other user interactions, directing the flow of data between the Model and the View.
