*This project is the idea of an LLM, but the implementation is human*

**Personalized Book Recommendation App** This application can help users discover new books based on their reading preferences, past reads, and mood. Here’s a breakdown of the features.

### Features

1. **User Profiles**: Allow users to create profiles where they can log their favorite genres, authors, and books they’ve read.
   *Note, there will be a privileged user, which can do CRUD operations on user accounts and history*

**Either use private methods or simply modify the GUI as agreed**


2. **Book Database**: Use an SQL database to store book information, including:
   - Title
   - Author
   - Genre
   - Summary
   - User ratings
   - Mood tags (e.g., uplifting, thought-provoking, etc.)


3. **Recommendation Engine**: Implement a simple algorithm that suggests books based on user preferences and past ratings. For example, if a user rates a mystery novel highly, recommend similar books.


4. **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for books by title, author, or genre.


5. **Reading List**: Users can create a reading list to keep track of books they want to read in the future.


6. **User Ratings and Reviews**: Users can rate books and leave reviews, which can help improve recommendations for others.


7. **Mood-Based Recommendations**: Allow users to select their current mood and receive book suggestions that match that mood.

### Database Schema

- **Users**: `user_id`, `username`, `password_hash`, `email`
- **Books**: `book_id`, `title`, `author`, `genre`, `summary`, `mood_tags`
- **Ratings**: `rating_id`, `user_id`, `book_id`, `rating`, `review`
- **Reading_List**: `list_id`, `user_id`, `book_id`

### PyQt6 Interface

1. **Main Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface where users can see their reading list, recent recommendations, and a search bar.

2. **Book Entry Form**: A form for users to add books to their reading list or rate and review books.

3. **Recommendation Section**: A dedicated area that displays personalized book recommendations based on user preferences.

4. **Search Results**: A view that shows search results with options to view book details, rate, or add to the reading list.

5. **User Profile**: A section where users can manage their preferences and view their reading history.

### Getting Started

1. **Set Up the Database**: Use SQLite to create the necessary tables for users, books, ratings, and reading lists.

2. **Create the PyQt6 GUI**: Start with the main dashboard and gradually add forms for book entry, search, and recommendations.

3. **Implement Functionality**: Connect the GUI to the database using SQL queries to handle CRUD operations and implement the recommendation logic.

4. **Implement Functionality**: Use an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate concerns and make your code more maintainable.

5. **Test and Iterate**: Test the application for bugs and usability issues, and gather feedback to improve the user experience.

### MVC (Model-View-Controller)

MVC, or Model-View-Controller, is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. It separates an application into three interconnected components, which helps organize code, improve maintainability, and facilitate collaboration among developers. Here’s a breakdown of each component:

[MVC presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUg2SWWK18I&t=30s)

### Components of MVC

1. **Model**:
   - The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, including retrieving, storing, and processing it.
   - In your book recommendation app, the Model would include classes or functions that handle database interactions, such as fetching book data, user profiles, ratings, etc.

2. **View**:
   - The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It presents the user interface and handles the layout and design.
   - In your app, the View would be the PyQt6 GUI components, such as windows, buttons, forms, and any other visual elements that users interact with.

3. **Controller**:
   - The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and then updates the View accordingly.
   - In your app, the Controller would handle events like button clicks, form submissions, and other user interactions, directing the flow of data between the Model and the View.

### ##################################[Example code]################################## 

**Prompt**
- This is my first time coding like this, and as I understood it, all of the data handling must be done in the model directory. But, let’s say, would book_model.py contain only the book_model class, and I would call it in main?

Yes, you're on the right track! In the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, the `model` directory is responsible for handling the data and business logic of your application. Here's how you can structure your `book_model.py` and how it interacts with the rest of your application:

**book_model.py**

This file should contain the `BookModel` class, which will handle all operations related to books, such as retrieving book data from the database, adding new books, updating existing books, and so on. Here's a simple example of what it might look like:

```python
# model/book_model.py

import sqlite3

class BookModel:
    def __init__(self, db_name='books.db'):
        self.connection = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
        self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()
        self.create_table()

    def create_table(self):
        self.cursor.execute('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Books (
                book_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                title TEXT,
                author TEXT,
                genre TEXT,
                summary TEXT,
                mood_tags TEXT
            )
        ''')
        self.connection.commit()

    def add_book(self, title, author, genre, summary, mood_tags):
        self.cursor.execute('''
            INSERT INTO Books (title, author, genre, summary, mood_tags)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        ''', (title, author, genre, summary, mood_tags))
        self.connection.commit()

    def get_books(self):
        self.cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM Books')
        return self.cursor.fetchall()

    def close(self):
        self.connection.close()
```

**main.py**

In your `main.py`, you would create an instance of the `BookModel` class and use it to interact with the book data. Here's a simple example:

```python
# main.py

from model.book_model import BookModel
from view.main_view import MainView
from controller.main_controller import MainController

def main():
    book_model = BookModel()
    main_view = MainView()
    main_controller = MainController(book_model, main_view)

    main_view.show()  # Display the main view

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Summary**

- **Model**: Contains the data handling logic (e.g., `BookModel` for books).
- **View**: Contains the user interface components (e.g., `MainView` for the main dashboard).
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, handling user input and updating the view accordingly (e.g., `MainController`).

In this setup, the `BookModel` class is responsible for all book-related data operations, and you can call its methods from the controller to perform actions based on user interactions in the view. This separation of concerns makes your code more organized and maintainable.

**Prompt** 
- And so if I understood correctly, when I would run main.py, I would get the PyQt interface, and clicking on the appropriate buttons would call the appropriate functions. If that’s the case, what would the code in main_controller look like, for, let’s say, adding a book

Yes, that's correct! When you run `main.py`, it will initialize the PyQt interface, and user interactions (like clicking buttons) will trigger functions in the controller. The controller will then call the appropriate methods in the model to perform actions like adding a book.

Here's an example of what the `main_controller.py` might look like, specifically for adding a book:

**main_controller.py**

```python
# controller/main_controller.py

from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QMessageBox

class MainController:
    def __init__(self, book_model, main_view):
        self.book_model = book_model
        self.main_view = main_view

        # Connect signals (button clicks) to methods
        self.main_view.add_book_button.clicked.connect(self.add_book)

    def add_book(self):
        # Get data from the view (assuming you have input fields for these)
        title = self.main_view.title_input.text()
        author = self.main_view.author_input.text()
        genre = self.main_view.genre_input.text()
        summary = self.main_view.summary_input.toPlainText()  # Assuming a QTextEdit for summary
        mood_tags = self.main_view.mood_tags_input.text()

        # Validate input (you can add more validation as needed)
        if not title or not author:
            QMessageBox.warning(self.main_view, "Input Error", "Title and Author are required!")
            return

        # Call the model to add the book
        self.book_model.add_book(title, author, genre, summary, mood_tags)

        # Optionally, clear the input fields after adding
        self.main_view.title_input.clear()
        self.main_view.author_input.clear()
        self.main_view.genre_input.clear()
        self.main_view.summary_input.clear()
        self.main_view.mood_tags_input.clear()

        # Show a success message
        QMessageBox.information(self.main_view, "Success", "Book added successfully!")

        # You might also want to refresh the book list in the view
        self.refresh_book_list()

    def refresh_book_list(self):
        # Fetch the updated list of books from the model
        books = self.book_model.get_books()
        self.main_view.update_book_list(books)  # Assuming you have a method to update the view
```

**Explanation**

1. **Initialization**: The `MainController` class takes instances of the `BookModel` and `MainView` as parameters. It connects the button click signal (`add_book_button.clicked`) to the `add_book` method.

2. **Adding a Book**:
   - The `add_book` method retrieves the input data from the view.
   - It performs basic validation to ensure that required fields (like title and author) are filled.
   - If validation passes, it calls the `add_book` method of the `BookModel` to add the book to the database.
   - After adding the book, it clears the input fields and shows a success message using a `QMessageBox`.

3. **Refreshing the Book List**: After adding a book, you might want to refresh the displayed list of books in the view. The `refresh_book_list` method fetches the updated list from the model and updates the view accordingly.

**Note**

Make sure that your `MainView` class has the appropriate input fields (like `title_input`, `author_input`, etc.) and methods (like `update_book_list`) to support this functionality. This structure keeps your code organized and adheres to the MVC pattern, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
